## About

I'm a freelance developer who loves to create things. I've being doing this for the past 8 years and was involved in creation of simple pages, custom e-commerce shops, api for mobile applications, parsers, bots and other tasks.

I love trying new technologies, value simplisity and I'm a fan of functional programming. One day I'd love to take part in development of a game and a mobile react-native application.

Tired of being a solo freelancer and looking for a good team at the moment.
